## Introduction

This project aims to automate various user interface tests on the OrangeHRM website to ensure its functionality and reliability. The framework is designed to be easily extensible and maintainable, allowing for the addition of new tests with minimal effort.

## Features

- **End-to-End UI Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for various functionalities of the OrangeHRM website.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Utilized for interacting with the web elements and performing actions.
- **TestNG**: Employed for organizing and managing test cases, providing powerful annotations and reporting capabilities.
- **Extent Reports**: Integrated to generate detailed and visually appealing reports of the test execution.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for developing the test scripts.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Tool for automating web application testing.
- **TestNG**: Testing framework for structuring and running tests.
- **Extent Reports**: Library for generating test execution reports.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jawadshahid07/OrangeHRM-Automation.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have the following installed:
    
    - Java Development Kit (JDK)
    - Apache Maven
      
   Install Maven dependencies:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Running the Tests

To execute the tests, use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn test
```

This command will compile the test classes and run the TestNG test suite defined in the testng.xml file.

## Test Reporting

The project uses Extent Reports to generate detailed and visually appealing test reports. After running the tests, the report will be generated in the test-output directory.

# Accessing the Report

1. Navigate to the test-output directory.
2. Open the ExtentReports.html file in a web browser to view the test results.

The report includes detailed information about each test, including the steps executed, the status (pass/fail), and any screenshots captured during the test execution.
